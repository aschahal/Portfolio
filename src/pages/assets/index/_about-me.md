Hello! My name is Amandeep Singh Chahal, a Unity Engine Developer at P1 Games and a computer science graduate from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. My academic and personal explorations in computer science have led me to develop a deep interest in several areas, notably game development, user interfaces, full-stack development, and data structures.

My journey in computer science has been one of constant discovery and learning. While I have immersed myself in various subfields, my passion for game development has been a significant driving force. The ability to create engaging, interactive experiences through the careful design of gameplay mechanics and systems is something I find deeply rewarding. This passion has guided me to pursue a career where I can bring ideas to life in virtual worlds.

In addition to game development, I am equally fascinated by the world of user interfaces. The intersection of functionality and aesthetics in UI design intrigues me, and I am passionate about creating interfaces that are not only secure but also intuitive and user-friendly. Balancing technical robustness with user experience has been a key focus in my personal and academic projects.

Another area that excites me is full-stack development. I thoroughly enjoy the process of building applications from the ground up, managing both the front-end and back-end development. It allows me to create cohesive, fully functional systems, and I find great satisfaction in knowing how different layers of an application interact. My projects have given me hands-on experience with several frameworks and tools that help bring a complete application to life.

Data structures form the fourth pillar of my academic pursuits. I am intrigued by the way efficient data structuring can optimize performance and solve complex problems. My coursework often involves delving into various data structures, understanding their applications, and leveraging them to build efficient and effective solutions.

As I prepare to graduate, I am enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead in the tech industry, particularly in roles that align with my interests in game development, user interface design, full-stack development, and data structures. I am keen to contribute my skills and learn from real-world experiences in these dynamic fields.
