- Design and implement scalable, reusable systems such as player input handling, AI behaviors, physics, and animation states, ensuring optimal performance in diverse game scenarios.

- Profile and optimize CPU, GPU, and memory usage for complex gameplay systems, minimizing frame drops and latency, often by working directly with low-level engine components (e.g., Unreal Engine, Unity).

- Develop asynchronous and multithreaded systems for real-time gameplay features, ensuring smooth networked interactions in player environments.

- Implement and refine physics-based interactions, collision detection, and response systems to ensure accurate and efficient physical behavior, including ragdoll effects, projectile trajectories, and environmental interactions.

- Integrate platform-specific SDKs (e.g., Steamworks, PlayFab) and RESTful APIs by writing custom bindings and wrappers in C++ or C#, ensuring asynchronous operations such as achievement tracking, in-game purchases, and player authentication function correctly and are optimized for low-latency performance.

- Develop and optimize HLSL/GLSL shaders for real-time rendering pipelines by implementing and fine-tuning vertex, fragment, and geometry shaders, achieving optimized lighting calculations, shadow mapping, and post-processing effects while minimizing GPU overdraw and instruction count.
