Currently building out a Flutter application using Dart called EcoQuest, a game to highlight eco-sustainability. This game was created at the Google Sponsored Global Citizens Gamers Hackathon. The application is projected to be used by over 100 users. Deliverables – Figma UI/UX Mockups, Google Wallet API Integration.

Sustainable games use the power of play to inspire positive environmental action. Imagine Candy Crush, but instead of crushing candies, you're crushing plastic pollution! Or picture a game like Super Dash, but instead of collecting acorns, you're turning off lights left on. Here are some more ideas inspired by Global Citizen campaigns running right now!

    - Encourage a reduction in home energy use
    - Encourage a reduction in use of single-use plastics
    - Encourage use of public transportation and overland options for longer distances

Data shows that American homes use an average 3x more kwh than the average home across the rest of the globe. Lets build a game that helps to reduce people’s reliance on inefficient energy sources.

Southeast Asia has some of the highest levels of plastic pollution in the world. Building a game that encourages players to make swaps to reduce reliance on single-use plastics.

Europe is home to many of the world’s greatest public transportation systems. Effective games can encourage people to use public transit rather than overland transport, like taking the train rather than flying for longer distances.

Just like Global Citizens do every day, we’re confident that games can encourage players to take small actions for the environment that when done collectively, lead to a large impact.
